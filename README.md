# ArrayInSwift
This repository has all files related to arrays in Swift 2.0 and above. Different files showcase the fundamentals of an array, its creation,declaration, accessing the elements inside any array, various operations that can be carried on an array and so on.

Normal 1 dimensional array, 2 or 3 dimensional arrays and their functionailities are also in the scope of this repository.

Arrays are ordered collections of values, unlike Sets or Dictionaries. An array stores values of the same type in an ordered list. That means that an array of Int can only store Int values and you can only insert Int values in it. 
The same value can appear in an array multiple times at different positions. Swift’s Array type is bridged to Foundation’s NSArray class.
